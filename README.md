# REMS-RTA

This program consists of two different Arduinos: A Mega representing the REMS (Remote Environment Management System), and a Nano representing the RTA (REMS Testing Application).

The REMS primarily consists of a webpage that sends requests to the RTA (turn on light, turn on cool, etc.).
